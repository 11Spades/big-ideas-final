    "The aim of this project is to quantitatively determine the Pittsburgh neighborhood that is the least depressing to live in. To achieve this, we will be providing a clearly defined metric that we believe may indicate this quality in a neighborhood. The metric will be quantitative in nature and will be sourced from the **Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center (WPRDC)**.\n",
    "Our approach is to pick three submetrics from the **WPRDC**, each of which we believe to have significance in our definition of *least depressing*, given below. We will analyze the submetrics individually, as well as considered together, to arrive at a verdict for overall least-depressiveness."
